A Gatsby site that incorporates GraphQL, JavaScript, CSS, etc. 
The "Introduction" page follows the online Gatsby tutorial, with a Static Image.
The "About" page is a simple Gatsby page.
The "Blog" page uses a markdown file and a frontmatter slug file to generate a small excerpt of an article with a link to the full page.
The "Recipe" and "Article" pages use templates and GraphQL to query from a database to display to the user as a list of links to the full recipe or article.
